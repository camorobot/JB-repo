                or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual 
                exploitation material. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from

                to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect

                analysis, and research to improve Camorobot products, services, and customer 
                communications.</li></ul>
            <br><ul><li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information
